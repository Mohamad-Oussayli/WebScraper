# WebScraper
Makani Application aims to facilitate the search process for any commercial, industrial or service activities in Lebanon in an advanced simple way by indexing and classifying businesses according to the detailed activity and the exact location sorted by alphabet or distance from the nearest to the farthest to you.
My project scrapped that data from the website and it saves it in a csv file. You can even select as a user a location and a sub-category, and the program will create a data frame with all the shops that have this sub-category and location and displays all the relevant data to this shop.
